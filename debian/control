Description: System info script for irc
 Infobash is a system information script for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) clients.
 A system information script can display all kinds of things about your 
 hardware and software to users in a chatroom,  so they can help you diagnose 
 problems, ... or just marvel at your system specs and kernel version ;)
 It was created to serve the need for a infoscript that isn't dependent on a 
 particular irc client. Because most irc clients support the /exec command, a 
 script that runs with /exec would be most portable.
